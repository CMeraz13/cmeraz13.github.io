The country's national motto Liberte, Egalite, Franernite ("Liberty, Equality and Fratenity") has its roots in the French Revolution, but wasn't popularized until the end of the 19th century. The famous trio of words were first vocalized in 1790 in a speech given by Maximilien Robespierre. Interestingly, the phrase is also the national motto of the Republic of Haiti (a former French colony). The French affectionately refer to their country as “L'Hexagone” ("the hexagon"), due to its geometrical shape. The country has a stuning city as well as its countryside if one wishes to get away from all the craziness of a city lifestyle.</p>

                <p class="paragraph_second_page_mid">Hawaii, the home of the worlds best shaved ice, creator of surfing and friendliness, really its not a joke! One of the FRIENDLY facts about Hawaii: We hug hello. We hug goodbye. We hug “I love you” and “I’m sorry” and “Nice to meet you” and “Thank you.” We just love to hug here! So don't be shocked if a local gives you a hug instead of a handshake. Hawaii sports many beautiful mountains, dormant volcanos, plenty of beachs between its 8 islands! This small state was once ruled by a monarchy, with kings and queens and princes and princesses. Lahaina (in West Maui) was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1824 to 1845. There’s a long, rich history in that little town! Hawaii still honors its ali'i (royalty) from the past. We celebrate Kamehameha Day on June 11 (honoring King Kamehameha the Great) and Prince Kuhio Day on March 26 (honoring Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole). Both dates are Hawaii state holidays and are marked with festivals and parades!</p>

                <p class="paragraph_second_page_mid">Iceland, contrary to it's name Iceland, isn't full of ice, that would be greenland. Confusing, right? Luckily for us, the name was to trick and confuse invaders, however we are here to enjoy the sights and its greenery! An Icelandic experience is not complete without a dip in a hot spring! The outdoor experience of bathing outdoors in volcanically heated pools dates back to Viking times. Hot springs can be found all around the country and come in all sizes and shapes. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled and your bathing suit in close reach. You don’t want to miss this experience! Since Iceland is covered in Glaciers, there are over 260! Whats crazier is that those 260 plus are also named! Thats alot of names! 60% of the population live in the captial area, meaning that the rest are spread out between small towns and those glaciers! </p>
