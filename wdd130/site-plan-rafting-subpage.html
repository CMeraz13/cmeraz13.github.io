            <p class="river_paragraphs">Class I rapids are defined by moving water with small waves that tug at the boat in a downstream flow - it's a relaxing way to spend the day. Rafting trips on class I whitewater are generally labeled as "scenic float trips". Most rivers have stretches of calm Class I water, creating a pleasant break between larger rapids.<br><br> Class II rapids are easy to navigate, generally broad sections of water moving fast enough to create 1 - 3 foot whitecaps. These are waves that are readily seen amidst broad channels that can be spotted without scouting the route from the shoreline. Some maneuvering is required to keep boat headed straight into each approaching wave.</p>
            <p class="river_paragraphs">Class III rapids feature waves up to 4 or 5 feet tall that will crash over the bow. Currents (hydraulics) will feel stronger, possibly channeling between brief narrow passages such as boulders or a cliff wall. Boats will shimmy and jolt with the increased punch of these larger waves, but generally the jolt is brief, with calmer and wider recovery area below each obstacle or wave. Plenty of excitement and fun with a guide at the helm! Non-guided rafters can find themselves in trouble in Class III rapids.<br><br>Class IV Rapids are larger waves, narrow passages and multiple obstacles to avoid, which require precise maneuvering to avoid upset. These rapids tend to be longer, steeper and more "technical" which translates to turns, spins and lateral moves across the current.</p>
            <p class="river_paragraphs">Another deserved level up from Class IV rapids, are the Class V Rapids, these look different (bigger and more intense). Expect vertical drops, strong currents, big waves, boulders and holes large enough to flip or hold boats in their more powerful hydraulics.<br><br>Class VI Rapids are generally considered "un-navigable" or "un-runnable", these are amplified versions of what you would find in Class V rapids.</p>

            <p class="colorado_paragraphs">From its genesis on the Continental Divide in Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park, the river originally known as the Grand grows from a cold mountain trout stream into a classic Western waterway slicing through jagged gorges between sweeping, pastoral ranchlands on the upper leg of a 1,450-mile journey. Its stature continues to swell as it carves through some of the planet’s most iconic landscapes—desert canyons, buttes, and mesas—before being bottled up and sucked dry by agriculture and municipal demand. Its once-mighty flow ends, in fact, several miles shy of the Gulf of California in Mexico.</p>
            <p class="colorado_paragraphs_two">Experience white water rafting through the Rocky Mountains and you will surely come back for more! You will raft through a beautiful canyon, past a gold mine, and view the occasional wildlife. Rafting trips at all levels are available from beginner family trips to advanced trips for experienced rafters. We will handle all the logistics and gear. All you need to do is enjoy the ride! We offer rafting adventures at 2 different locations. Raft through the stunning Royal Gorge Canyon or stay closer to Denver and raft one of the fastest rivers in the country. Ask us about adding a gold mine tour to your rafting trip. Both are located in the same place!</p>
